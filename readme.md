# Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) Repository üìöüß†‚öõÔ∏è  
*A curated collection of theory, frameworks, and solved examples bridging machine learning and physical laws.*  

---

## Overview üåê  
This repository explores **Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)**, a paradigm that integrates domain-specific physics (e.g., conservation laws, PDEs, symmetries) into machine learning pipelines. The goal is to enhance model accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability for scientific and engineering challenges.  

**What‚Äôs Inside?**  
- **Theory**: High-level frameworks for embedding physics across the ML pipeline (problem formulation ‚Üí optimization).  
- **Examples**: Implementations of PIML techniques for real-world problems, starting with the **simple pendulum** 
- **Applications**: Future additions will cover turbulence modeling, digital twins, materials discovery, and climate science.

## Key Features ‚ú®  
### 1. **Physics Integration Across ML Stages**  
- **Problem Formulation**: Define inputs/outputs using physical quantities (e.g., forces, energy).  
- **Data Curation**: Augment data with symmetries (rotation/translation invariance) and physical coordinates.  
- **Architecture Design**: Built-in inductive biases (e.g., Lagrangian Neural Networks, SINDy Autoencoders).  
- **Loss Functions**: Hybrid objectives balancing data fidelity and physics (e.g., PINNs, regularization).  
- **Optimization**: Constrained training via Lagrange multipliers or differentiable programming.  

### 2. **Case Studies**  
- **[Simple Pendulum](./examples/simple_pendulum)**: Solve the damped pendulum equation using PINNs
- *Upcoming*: Turbulence closure, shape optimization, and protein folding examples.  

### 3. **Theory Deep Dives**  
- Structured frameworks for PIML workflows.  
- Best practices for balancing data-driven and physics-based modeling.  
- Ethical considerations (e.g., thermodynamic limits in climate models).
