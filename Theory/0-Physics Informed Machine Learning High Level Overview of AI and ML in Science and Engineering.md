### 1. Introduction  
Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) merges data-driven methodologies with physical principles to address complex scientific and engineering challenges. This chapter outlines a structured framework for embedding physics into each stage of the machine learning (ML) pipeline, from problem formulation to optimization, and highlights applications across domains such as fluid dynamics, materials science, and digital twins. By leveraging both known physics and data-driven discovery, PIML enables models that are accurate, generalizable, and computationally efficient.

### 2. A Structured Framework for PIML  
The ML pipeline is divided into five stages, each offering unique opportunities to integrate physics:  

#### **2.1 Stage 1: Problem Formulation**  
- **Objective**: Define inputs, outputs, and the physical relationship to model.  
- **Physics Integration**:  
  - Frame problems around physical quantities (e.g., forces, energy potentials).  
  - Example: Modeling turbulence closure terms in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations.  
  - Use domain knowledge to select coordinates (e.g., Hamiltonian/Lagrangian frameworks).  

#### **2.2 Stage 2: Data Curation**  
- **Objective**: Gather and preprocess data reflective of physical laws.  
- **Physics Integration**:  
  - **Data Augmentation**: Enforce symmetries (e.g., rotating/translating fluid flow data).  
  - **Coordinate Systems**: Transform data into physically meaningful coordinates (e.g., geocentric vs. heliocentric planetary motion).  
  - Example: Curating fluid velocity fields across flow regimes to capture multiphysics interactions.  

#### **2.3 Stage 3: Architecture Design**  
- **Objective**: Choose models that inherently respect physics.  
- **Physics Integration**:  
  - **Inductive Biases**: Embed conservation laws or symmetries into architectures.  
    - *Lagrangian Neural Networks*: Enforce energy conservation.  
    - *SINDy Autoencoders*: Promote parsimony via sparse symbolic regression.  
  - Example: Galilean-invariant neural networks for turbulence modeling (Julia Ling et al.).  

#### **2.4 Stage 4: Loss Function Design**  
- **Objective**: Craft objectives that balance data fidelity and physical consistency.  
- **Physics Integration**:  
  - **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Penalize PDE residuals (e.g., Navier-Stokes).  
  - **Regularization**: Add terms for sparsity (L1/L0 norms) or energy conservation.  
  - Example: Training a pendulum model with a loss combining angle prediction and equation residuals.  

#### **2.5 Stage 5: Optimization**  
- **Objective**: Train models to satisfy physical constraints.  
- **Physics Integration**:  
  - **Constrained Optimization**: Use Lagrange multipliers to enforce exact conservation (e.g., incompressible flows).  
  - **Differentiable Programming**: Leverage automatic differentiation for adjoint-free design.  
  - Example: Shape optimization of aircraft wings using gradient-based methods.
